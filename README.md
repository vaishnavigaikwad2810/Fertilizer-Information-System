#  Fertilizer Information System 
Fertilizer Information System is nothing but it provides information about various types of fertilizers.
Before actually going through the final implementation of the Fertilizer Management System Application, you need to understand a few terms. These are related to the files and packages present in the source code of the application.

We will provide you with the source code of the Fertilizer Management System Application later, and after opening that project, you may find it difficult to understand a few terms. So to avoid the late trouble, we are making it clear now itself.

1.	Manifest File – The online attendance app project files have a manifest file where all the app permissions and declarations are present.

2.	Gradle File – The Gradle file consists of many dependencies of the libraries that have been used to build the Fertilizer Management System Application

3.	MainActivity – The MainActivity file is the first activity of the Fertilizer Management System Application

4.	Resources – The res folder contains various resources that behave as assets for the Fertilizer Management System Application . The files present inside the res folder are colors, strings, layout, and styles. By changing their values, you can customize your application.

5.	 Firebase – Firebase is a cloud-based backend tool using which the Fertilizer app is deployed. It provides the app a real-time database and also a feature to authenticate the user.




## Installation

Install my project with android studio

```bash


So, I hope you understand what an fertilizer information  app is and are ready to implement it. So, to make the process easier for you, we have attached the source code of the online attendance app along with this app. The source code of the fertilizer  information  app has comments to guide you through every line present in the code.

Below are the steps you need to follow appropriately to access and run the project in your system.

Step 1: Head over to the link above to get the source code of the fertilizer  informationt app. After opening the link, you need to download the zip file of the project.

Step 2: Extract the downloaded zip file and then open your android studio. Select open an existing project in your Android Studio and then open the attendance app project through it.

Step 3: Let the files load in your Android Studio and then go to tools and select Firebase. Now add Firebase auth and firebase real-time database.

Step 4: Now go to the Firebase console using the below link and then enable firebase authentication from there.

https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/

Step 5: Now, rebuild your  project and then run it on your device or emulator.

```
    
## Flow of the project

You need to understand the various screens and their use before proceeding with the development of the Fertilizer App.

●	Login Screen – You need to provide a login screen in your fertilizer application to allow the users to log in. 

●	Welcome Screen – You need to provide the users(student or teacher) with a welcome screen 
having the title “Welcome To Fertilizer App.”

●	Fertilizer  Information Screen – The Available fertilizer  Screen contains the list of all the available  fertilizer  for the farmer
